# Oasis-Java-Developement-Internship-Task 1

I am Suhani Gupta.
I've create a Number Guessing Game using java.
A number guessing game aims to guess the number that the program has come up with. 
Essentially the program logic is: The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 or 
any other combination of numbers. It will then ask the player to enter his proposal.

I have completed my Task 1 as Java Development Intern at Oasis Infobyte.
